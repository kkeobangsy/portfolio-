                      Hi, my name is Khamphong Keobangsy, but my friends call me Tom. I was born in Thailand when Vietnam War was going on.
                      As the war was ending my parents got on the plane to come to the the Unite State. We did not have anything, but our
                      clothes on our backs when we came here. florida was warm like our home country.  I went to Pinellas Park high from
                      9th grade to 12 grade this is when you have to choose your friends you might make a mistake or two, but you will
                      see who is there for you. After, I went to Pinellas Technical College for computer technology and graduate with
                      a certificate. Now I am in St.Peterburg College with cerification, but going for A.S degree in Web development.
